# PitchPaint

PitchPaint uses ReactNative to target a cross-platform userbase.
 
To get started please follow these instructions to set up your environment:

>Please follow this link for specific instructions:
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

In a directory unrelated to our repo test the following:
```sh
#test your environment works
react-native init TestProject 
cd TestProject 
#before you run make sure XCode is open, 
#otherwise your project will not compile in the simulator
react-native run-ios
```

Once you have set up your environment branch your own copy of the repository
